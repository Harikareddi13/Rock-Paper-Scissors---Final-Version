# Rock-Paper-Scissors---Final-Version 

The **final Rock Paper Scissors** brings all features together into a polished, interactive game.  
You can **play manually** (clicking icons), use **keyboard shortcuts** (`r`, `p`, `s`), or enable **Autoplay mode**, where the computer plays automatically every second.  
Scores are **tracked with localStorage**, persist after refresh, and can be **reset anytime**, making this the most complete version of the project.
